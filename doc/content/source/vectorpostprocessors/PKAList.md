# PKAList

!syntax description /VectorPostprocessors/PKAList

This vector postprocessor dumps the entire list of all primary knock-on atoms
(PKAs) generated by the active PKA generators in the current timestep. It
provides the following columns:

| Column | Description |
| - | - |
| x | Point of origin x-coordinate |
| y | Point of origin y-coordinate |
| z | Point of origin z-coordinate |
| seed | Random number seed for the recoil cascade initiated by this PKA |
| m | PKA mass |
| Z | PKA nuclear charge |

Note that each PKA has an assigned random number generator seed. This enables
reproducible random number generation in parallel runs, where PKAs are
distributed among multiple compute nodes.
