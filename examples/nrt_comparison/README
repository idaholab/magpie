Verification cases considered here
==================================

 Al2O2:
-------
* Damage energy efficiency from [1]. The reference data was created using Eq. (9) and the
  coefficients in Table 1.
* Damage efficiency kij computed by Eq. (8) from [2] using Ecap_ij = (18, 45, 45, 72).
  Edisp_j = (18, 72).

U_xZr_1-x_C:
------------
* Damage energy efficiency from [1].

TaO:
----
* Damage efficiency kij from [2] using Ecap_ij = (60, 60, 60, 60).

UC:
---
* Damage efficiency kif from [2] at 1e7 eV.
