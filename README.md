**Magpie** (_Mesoscale Atomistic Glue Program for Integrated Execution_) is a glue application to link various atomistic codes to applications based on the [MOOSE Finite Element Framework](http://mooseframework.org).

Magpie will provide coupling modules for

* [SPPARKS](http://spparks.sandia.gov/), the kinetic Monte Carlo code by Sandia National Laboratory
* [MyTRIM](http://github.com/idaholab/mytrim/), a binary collision Monte Carlo code for ion transport in materials
* [LAMMPS](http://lammps.sandia.gov/), the molecular dynamics code by Sandia National Laboratory

and possibly others.
